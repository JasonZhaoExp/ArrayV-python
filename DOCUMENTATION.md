## Writing sorting algorithms
- Variable names are not taken into account, you can use any.
- You can include external functions.
- The program will only accept algorithms with the following two functions in them:

```py
def name():
    return name
```
The variable "name" is a string that will be used in the results file.

```py
def sort(array):
    # Insert code here
    return sorted_array
```

## Writing search algorithms
- Variable names are not taken into account, you can use any.
- You can include external functions.
- The program will only accept algorithms with the following two functions in them:

```py
def name():
    return name
```
The variable "name" is a string that will be used in the results file. 
```py
def search(array, looking_for):
    # Insert code here
    
    # If looking_for is found:
        return index_of_looking_for
    # If looking_for is not found:
        return False
```
